# Logically
#### A Programming Language for logic circuits

---

### About
Logically is a scripting language that can derive the combinational logic circuit of any logic expression. Given a set of logic operations, the language is capable of analyzing the resulting function and with a series of computations, a logical circuit will be derived.

### Language Features
* Design logical circuits by implementing individual logic gates.
* Create complex logical expressions from logic circuits.
* Test circuits by generating truth tables.
* Simplify any logical expression with a single command.
* Generate visual circuit diagrams from generated circuits.
* Display the Venn Diagram of a given logical expression.

### Installation
###### Dependencies
* Python 3.4 with the following packages:
  * SchemDraw
  * Matplotlib
  * TKinter
